## Iris Dataset Classification 
## Overview
This project involves the implementation of two classification algorithms, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), on the Iris dataset. The primary goal is to compare the accuracy of these algorithms in predicting the species of iris flowers based on their features.
## Dataset
The Iris dataset comprises of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. The features include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
## Results
The accuracy and confusion matrix results for both Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms are displayed during script execution.
## Conclusion
This project provides a comparative analysis of Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms on the Iris dataset. The results can help in determining the most suitable algorithm for this specific classification task.
